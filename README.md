## 🚀 Project Overview

DBKala is a fully designed and implemented relational database system that simulates a real-world e-commerce platform (similar to Digikala).

The project covers the complete lifecycle of database engineering:

* Schema design & normalization

* Business rule enforcement

* Trigger-based logic

* Data generation at scale

* Analytical querying

* Performance optimization

Built using PostgreSQL with a strong focus on correctness, integrity, and scalability.
